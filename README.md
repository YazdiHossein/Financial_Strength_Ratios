# Financial_Strength_Ratios
Financial strength ratios: 
•	*Working Cap = Current Asset - Current Lib
•	*Current Ratio = Current Asset/Current Lib
•	*Quick Ratio (Acid-test)= [Cash+ Cash Equivalent + Short-term Investment + Net Current Rec]/Current Lib (is good when it is bet 0.9&1)
	Net Rec: The receivables minus the amount that never being paid back of Rec.

The third ratio, Quick Ratio, is not calculated because of not accessing to the details of current assets, other than cash and cash equivalents. 

In this try, the only first two ratios are prepared by VBA Macro in excel for the sample file attached.
